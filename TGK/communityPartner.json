We also know there are many causes worthy of your support. By focusing our resources in a few areas, we feel our impact to the food service community is much greater.\n\nWe hate to put you “through the hoops” when you are eager to partner with us, but this system helps us immensely with our decision-making and record-keeping processes. We appreciate your commitment and time in supporting our efforts to make effective decisions toward the betterment of our industry.",
