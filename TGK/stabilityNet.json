This program partners Atlanta Volunteer Lawyers Foundation with schools and other community allies to focus AVLF’s volunteer resources on improving living conditions and housing stability in low-income neighborhoods – all to improve resident health, reduce school enrollment turnover, and enhance student attendance and performance. All of their program staff is embedded within neighborhoods to stop housing instability early and work as a first responder when problems do arise. ",
